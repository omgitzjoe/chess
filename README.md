# Overview

Using the Kotlin language, this is a basic chess interface.
It assumes player compliance with playing by the rules. It does ensure that 
proper syntax and coordinates are chosen by the player.
I wrote this to practice using Kotlin syntax to make a game that I love and enjoy.

I spent roughly 24 hours researching, installing, and coding.

# AI Disclosure
-I used AI learning purposes as to the syntax specific to Kotlin. I used it to build the chess piece images, 
sparing me from looking up each unicode value. I used it to help debugging process with mild success. 
It also assisted in helping me reduce complexity and increase cohesion between functions.
